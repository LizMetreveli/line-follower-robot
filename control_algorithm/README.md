# Control Algorithms

This folder documents the control logic and programming decisions used in the line-follower robot.
The focus is on algorithm design, iteration, and real-time behavior rather than hardware implementation details.

The robot operates using a closed-loop control system for line following, with an additional behavior layer for obstacle detection.
Both algorithms were developed iteratively based on real-world performance and testing.
