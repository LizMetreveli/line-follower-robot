# Line-Follower Robot

## Overview
This project implements an autonomous line-following robot using embedded C.
The robot detects a line using sensors and adjusts motor behavior in real time to remain on the path.

## System Description
Sensor inputs are read by a microcontroller and processed using control logic to determine motor commands.
The system operates in a closed loop, continuously correcting its trajectory based on sensor feedback. IR sensors are used for path control and ultrasonic sensors are used for obstacle detection. 

## My Contributions
- Mapped and integrated the full electrical system, including power distribution and component interfacing
- Developed embedded C software for sensor reading and motor control
- Implemented control logic using thresholds and state-based decisions
- Debugged sensor noise and real-time behavior during testing
- Documented system design and implementation in a technical report

## Technical Focus
- Embedded C programming
- GPIO input/output
- Real-time control logic
- Hardware–software integration

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a team. The repository documents my personal contributions and learning outcomes.
